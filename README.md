The directory for each day contains both the example input file, the actual input file, and the code solution. To easily run a specific day's solution, use:

```
python3 run.py <day> <input_file>
```

For example:

```
python3 run.py 1 example.txt
```

NOTE: by default, if no input file is specified, the day's solution will run on input.txt.
